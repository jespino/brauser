## How it works?

It uses the templates from _template_ to generate a _index.html_ file.

## Usage

Usage: generate [-h] [-t TITLE] [-o OUTFILE] [-i PATH]
  
  -p PATH     use PATH instead of the current working directory
  -o OUTFILE  write result to OUTFILE instead of index.html
  -t TITLE    change TITLE on the navigation bar
  -h          display this help and exit
